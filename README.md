# Rcode_WhiteStork_Foraging
R scripts used for movement ecology analysis on white storks (Ciconia ciconia). This repository includes data processing, visualization, and statistical analysis code.
The scripts focus on behavioural classification, environmental data processing, and statistical analyses.

## 📂 Repository Structure  

### Behavioural Analysis  
- **`Model_bhvClassif_rabc.Rmd`** → Builds and evaluates a behavioural classification model based on acceleration data.  

### Environmental Data Processing  
- **`SPEIcalculation.Rmd`** → Computes the Standardized Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) for two french stations to assess environmental conditions affecting storks foraging behaviour.  

### Statistical Analysis  
- **`statHRkernels.Rmd`** → Mixed models to test which factors influence the storks home range size  
- **`statNestDistances.Rmd`** → Mixed models to test which factors influence the daily distance from the nest 
- **`statODBA.Rmd`** → Mixed models to test which factors influence the mean daily Overall Dynamic Body Acceleration (ODBA) of storks
- **`statPropWalk.Rmd`** → Mixed models to test which factors influence storks monthly proportion on walk behavior
