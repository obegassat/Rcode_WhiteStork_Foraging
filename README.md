# Rcode_WhiteStork_Foraging
R scripts used for movement ecology analysis. This repository includes data processing, visualization, and statistical analysis code.
The scripts focus on behavioral classification, environmental data processing, and statistical analyses.  

## 📂 Repository Structure  

### 🏃 Behavioral Analysis  
- **`Model_bhvClassif_rabc.Rmd`** → Builds and evaluates a behavioral classification model based on acceleration data.  

### 🌍 Environmental Data Processing  
- **`SPEIcalculation.Rmd`** → Computes the Standardized Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) for two french stations to assess environmental conditions affecting storks foraging behavior.  

### 📊 Statistical Analysis  
- **`statHRkernels.Rmd`** → Mixed models to test which factors influence the storks home range size  
- **`statNestDistances.Rmd`** → Mixed models to test which factors influence the daily distance from the nest 
- **`statODBA.Rmd`** → Mixed models to test which factors influence the mean daily Overall Dynamic Body Acceleration (ODBA) of storks
- **`statPropWalk.Rmd`** → Mixed models to test which factors influence storks monthly proportion on walk behavior
